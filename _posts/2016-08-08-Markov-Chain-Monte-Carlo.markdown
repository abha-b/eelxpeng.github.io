After learned variational inference and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), I wrote a paper about Gaussian relational topic model to solve the problem of connection discovery using shared images. In order to continue solve more challenging problems and improving myself, I find it necessary to master Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Therefore, I put my hands on Gibbs sampling and Metropolis Hastings algorithm.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
