After learned variational inference and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), I wrote a paper about Gaussian relational topic model to solve the problem of connection discovery using shared images [to be announced]. In order to continue solve more challenging problems and improving myself, I find it necessary to master Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Therefore, I put my hands on Gibbs sampling and Metropolis Hastings algorithm.
