Lately, I'm trying to investigate Bayesian Deep Learning and seriously considering it to be my PhD topic. Combining Bayesian with Deep Learning is current hot topic and with the current development of stochastic gradient monte carlo, I think it's time for Bayesian Deep Learning to fly. And I could probably benefit from it a lot.

A perfect tutorial for introduction of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is [MCMC: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (a.k.a. Hybrid Monte Carlo)](https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/mcmc-hamiltonian-monte-carlo-a-k-a-hybrid-monte-carlo/).
