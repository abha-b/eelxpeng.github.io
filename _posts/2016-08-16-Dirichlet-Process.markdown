Lately I'm dealing with Bayesian non-parametric in order for the praparation of my next paper. Therefore, I spent several days trying to learn and understand Dirichlet process. Dirichlet process is at first difficult to understand, mainly because it is very different from our previous parametric methods and it uses advanced mathmetical concepts. I struggled several days to finally understand Dirichlet process. Once you understand it, it becomes very easy.
